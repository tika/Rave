<b>Rave</b> is a simple to use parties plugin, inspired by the original Hypixel parties system, made for simplicity

### Features
<ul>
<li>Invite - invites a player to your party</li>
<li>Join - accepts an invite and joins the player's party</li>
<li>List - lists the members and information about your party</li>
<li>Leave - leaves your current party</li>
<li>Chat - enables party-only chat mode</li>
<li>Kick - kicks a member from your party</li>
<li>Promote - promotes a specified member to the party leader</li>
</ul>

### Versions
Currently <b>Rave</b> is only available for 1.16 Spigot but with plans to support <b>1.8.x+</b>

### Ideas for the future
- Adding integration support for McMMO & other plugins that take advantage of parties, such as xp boosters
- Adding a "warping" feature for networks (works the same way as Hypixel party warps)
